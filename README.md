Power Cast is a web server tool designed for beginers to host their own website.


**Setting up Power Cast**

1. Install the latest release
2. Allow Power Cast to pass the firewall
3. from this point you can press start server and it will be local (find it at http://localhost/)
4. Follow your routers guide on port forwarding to make it public.
5. You can edit the website via the WWWROOT button which takes you to the folder where all the website files are stored,
   basic knowledge of how sites work is reccomended. You can use Microsoft word to create a web page file or you can hand code it.
